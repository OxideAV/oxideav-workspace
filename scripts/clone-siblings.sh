#!/bin/bash
# Clone every OxideAV/oxideav-* repo into crates/ so the workspace is
# fully self-contained — no crates.io resolution needed for any oxideav-*
# dep, local development and CI both work from a single `cargo build`.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/clone-siblings.sh
#
# Behaviour:
#   * Enumerates OxideAV repos via the `gh` CLI.
#   * Skips repos that are not Rust crates (`.github`, `oxideav.github.io`,
#     `oxideav-dot-github`, `demo-repository`) and the workspace repo itself
#     (`oxideav-workspace`).
#   * For each remaining repo: if `crates/<name>` does not exist, clones
#     it; otherwise leaves it alone (doesn't fetch, doesn't touch local
#     work).
#
# CI-safe: uses HTTPS clones via `gh repo clone`, which works with the
# default `GITHUB_TOKEN` in GitHub Actions.
