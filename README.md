# oxideav

A **100% pure Rust** media transcoding and streaming framework. No C libraries, no FFI wrappers, no `*-sys` crates — just Rust, all the way down.

## Goals

- **Pure Rust implementation.** Never depend on `ffmpeg`, `libav`, `x264`, `libvpx`, `libopus`, or any other C library — directly or transitively. Every codec, container, and filter is implemented from the spec.
- **Clean abstractions** for codecs, containers, timestamps, and streaming formats.
- **Composable pipelines**: media input → demux → decode → transform → encode → mux → output, with pass-through mode for remuxing without re-encoding.
- **Modular workspace**: per-format crates for complex modern codecs/containers, a shared crate for simple standard formats, and an aggregator crate that ties them together behind Cargo features.

## Non-goals

- Wrapping existing C codec libraries.
- Perfect feature parity with FFmpeg on day one. Codec and container coverage grows incrementally.
- GPU-specific acceleration (may come later through pure-Rust compute libraries, but never C drivers).

### Why split formats into separate crates?

- **Complex codecs are large.** An H.264 or Opus implementation is tens of thousands of lines. Keeping each one in its own crate means users who don't need H.264 don't pay for it in build time, binary size, or audit scope.
- **Parallel compilation.** Independent crates compile concurrently.
- **Clean API boundaries.** Each format crate only depends on `oxideav-core`, `oxideav-codec`, and/or `oxideav-container` — never on other format crates. Cross-format glue lives in the aggregator.
- **Opt-in dependencies.** The aggregator crate uses Cargo features (`oxideav = { features = ["mkv", "opus"] }`) so downstream users pick exactly the formats they need.

### What goes in `oxideav-basic`?

Formats that are:
- Small (hundreds of lines, not thousands),
- Standard and stable (RFC-pinned, no algorithm variants to track),
- Useful as building blocks (PCM is needed any time you touch raw audio).

If a format grows beyond that — multiple profiles, complex bitstream parsing, optional tooling — it gets promoted to its own crate.

## Core concepts

- **Packet** — a chunk of compressed (encoded) data belonging to one stream, with timestamps.
- **Frame** — a chunk of uncompressed data (audio samples or a video picture).
- **Stream** — one media track inside a container (audio, video, subtitle…).
- **TimeBase / Timestamp** — rational time base per stream; timestamps are integers in that base.
- **Demuxer** — reads a container, emits Packets per stream.
- **Decoder** — turns Packets of a given codec into Frames.
- **Encoder** — turns Frames into Packets.
- **Muxer** — writes Packets into an output container.
- **Pipeline** — connects these pieces. A pipeline can pass Packets straight from Demuxer to Muxer (remux, no quality loss) or route through Decoder → [Filter] → Encoder.

## Current status

Early-stage. Bootstrapping the workspace and initial end-to-end demo (WAV + PCM via `oxideav-basic`).

## Roadmap

1. Workspace, core types, codec/container traits ← **in progress**
2. `oxideav-basic`: WAV container + PCM codec (first end-to-end)
3. `oxideav` aggregator + CLI (`probe`, `transcode`, `info`)
4. Pipeline composition with passthrough / remux
5. First dedicated format crate (likely `oxideav-flac` or `oxideav-ogg`)
6. Filters: resample, sample-format conversion, pixel-format conversion, scale
7. Expand codec/container catalog one crate at a time

## Building

```
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

The `oxideav` binary is produced by the `oxideav-cli` crate:

```
cargo run -p oxideav-cli -- --help
```

## License

TBD (likely MIT OR Apache-2.0).
