//! `oxideav-sysaudio`-backed audio output engine.
//!
//! `sysaudio` dlopen's the native audio API at runtime (ALSA,
//! PulseAudio, WASAPI, CoreAudio, …) so `oxideplay` has no
//! `libasound.so.2` / `libpulse.so.0` / `ole32.dll` / `AudioToolbox`
//! entry in its dynamic-link requirements. The backend gives us a
//! pull-callback; we feed it from a lock-free SPSC ring buffer that
//! `queue` fills. The callback increments a `samples_played` atomic
//! that the engine reports as the master clock.
//!
//! Driver selection: by default we pick `probe()`'s top choice (e.g.
//! PipeWire → PulseAudio → ALSA → OSS on Linux). The [`Self::with_driver`]
//! constructor lets the CLI force `pulse`, `alsa`, `wasapi`, etc.
//! directly.
