//! Inverse Modified Discrete Cosine Transform + sin/sin window for Vorbis.
//!
//! The IMDCT here is the textbook O(N²) form. Vorbis blocksizes top out at
//! 8192, so a single transform is ~33M multiplies — slow but correct.
//! Optimisation (split-radix FFT, pre-twiddled butterflies) is left for
//! later passes.
//!
//! Vorbis I §1.3.4 (windowing) and §1.3.5 (IMDCT).
