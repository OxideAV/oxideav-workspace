//! Aggregator crate for oxideav.
//!
//! Depend on this crate to pull in codecs and containers from the wider
//! oxideav ecosystem, gated by Cargo features. Each format crate maps to
//! exactly one feature here:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! oxideav = { version = "*", features = ["basic", "ogg", "vorbis", "flac"] }
//! ```
